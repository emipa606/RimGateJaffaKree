  <description>When I was young, one of my favorite TV Show was Stargate! Now, after so many years I still feel the same nostalgia and I am not the only one. Back in A8, Carnov made a mod which brought the Jaffa with weapons and armor into Rimworld. And now with A16, I once again bring them back! They are not lore friendly and I wont even make an excuss for why they may be. If you are a Stargate fan like myself, you will love the mod! Enjoy!
