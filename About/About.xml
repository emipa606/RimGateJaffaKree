When I was young, one of my favorite TV Show was Stargate! Now, after so many years I still feel the same nostalgia and I am not the only one. Back in A8, Carnov made a mod which brought the Jaffa with weapons and armor into Rimworld. And now with A16, I once again bring them back! They are not lore friendly and I wont even make an excuss for why they may be. If you are a Stargate fan like myself, you will love the mod! Enjoy! 

Updated for the Alien Race Framework by Xen!
	
Features:
- Custom head texture! Fully working with all vanilla and modded hairstyles! 
- Custom Jaffa Amor and helmets! 
- Three new, hidden Factions! Each with a unique helmet! (Anubis, Ra and Apophis) 
- Custom names! Each Jaffa has a chance to spawn with a custom name! 
- New Weapons! The Ma'Tok Staff and the Zat'nik'tel! Each with custom sounds! 
- Longer Lifespan than normal humans!
